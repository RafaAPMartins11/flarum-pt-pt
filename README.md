This repository was forked from [bertaveira/flarum-pt-pt](https://github.com/bertaveira/flarum-pt-pt). Appreciate the work put into it, and the goal is to update the abandoned repository and keep it maintained.

## Compatibility

This language pack was tested with **flarum 1.8** but should work with most versions.

## Installation

It is recommended to install via composer:

```
composer require RafaAPMartins11/flarum-pt-pt
```

## Update

```
composer update RafaAPMartins11/flarum-pt-pt
php flarum cache:clear
```
